# TimeSeriesSimulation.jl

[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/hendersontrent/TimeSeriesSimulation.jl/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hendersontrent/TimeSeriesSimulation.jl)

Automatic simulation of numerous types of dynamical systems and time-series processes.

## Notes

This package is intended to be a growing resource and is continuously being added to with more models, systems, and processes. In addition, while many great packages exist for simulating time-series models, this package is both: (i) trying to be as lightweight as possible; and (ii) a source of practice of manual system specification for the author.
