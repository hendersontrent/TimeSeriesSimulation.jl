# toker-models
Builds interesting models in Julia that are specified in the Toker, Sommer, and D'Esposito (2020) paper titled ["A simple method for detecting chaos in nature"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0715-9).

The repository is structured according to a rough categorisation of systems into:

* Autoregressive processes
* Differential equations
* Maps
* Other systems

The *other systems* group may be refactored into more specific folders as more systems are added. The repository is not exhaustive yet, but is being continuously updated with new systems. It is intended to be a living bank of ready-to-use simulated time-series systems written in Julia.
