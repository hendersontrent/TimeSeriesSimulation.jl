# toker-models
Builds a few interesting models in Julia that are specified in the Toker, Sommer, and D'Esposito (2020) paper titled ["A simple method for detecting chaos in nature"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0715-9).

The repository is structured according to a rough categorisation of systems into:

* Autoregressive processes
* Differential equations
* Other systems

The *other systems* group may be refactored into more specific folders as more systems are added.
